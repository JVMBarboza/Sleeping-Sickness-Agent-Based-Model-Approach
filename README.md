# Sleeping Sickness Agent-Based Model
Agent based model for the simulation of Sleep Sickness disease behavior in a five thousand human population 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to get a copy of the project in your local machine for development, testing, and research purposes. 

## Prerequisites

During the implementation of the model those were the tools used, therefore, highly recomended as prerequisites for the simulations using the script. Otherwise it is possible to run manually and item I) becomes the only prerequisite necessary**(see Acknowledgments to better info).

```
    I)   GCC (version 7.5.0)
    II)  Python (3.7.6)
    III) Matplotlib (3.1.3)
    IV)  Pandas (1.0.1)
    V)   Numpy (1.18.1)
```

## Installing

No instalation, just modify and execute "run.sh"

## Running

    i)  change the main R variable in each simulation for better results since a different value of R implies different pseudo random numbers. Also remember to modify the directory of simulation results in python files(**).

    ii) modify variable values in sed command.

## Built With

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - Compiler 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Used to graphics and output files manipulation
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Graphics
* [Pandas](https://pandas.org/) - Data manipulation
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Data manipulation

## Acknowledgments

*) As mentioned, if the user don't feel confortable using python tools, it is possible to run everything manually using the main.c in the "maincode" directory or inserting "#" in the python line(s) in the script.

**)pay attention to the name of output files in the script and in the python codes "results/directory", have to be the same to work fine.
